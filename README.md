# Chronic Pain Community Platform

## Background

This project emerged as a challenge presented by Teietoevry during Junction 2023. The development journey unfolded over approximately 12 hours, led by a team of junior-level developers. For some team members, this experience marked their first foray into collaborative coding efforts.

Acknowledging the imperfections in the project, our team deeply appreciated the learning process and the unique challenges that came with it. The endeavor not only allowed us to tackle the specific task at hand but also provided valuable insights into teamwork, coding collaboration, and the intricacies of real-world development challenges.

While the project may not be flawless, the enjoyment derived from the process and the lessons learned have been immensely rewarding. The experience of working together as a team of junior developers on a time-constrained challenge like Junction 2023 has undoubtedly contributed to our growth and understanding of the development landscape.

## Overview

Welcome to our Pain Management platform! This platform is designed to support individuals struggling with chronic pain, addressing not only the physical aspects but also recognizing the significant mental component of drug dependence. Our goal is to provide a community-like space where users can find encouragement, share experiences, access information, and adopt alternative approaches to manage chronic pain.

## Features

### 1. Community Hub

Our platform serves as a virtual community hub, bringing together individuals facing chronic pain issues. Here, users can share their experiences, provide support to others, and find motivation on their journey towards pain management.

### 2. Information and Suggestions

We offer a comprehensive repository of information, suggestions, and alternative approaches to help users better understand and cope with chronic pain. This includes articles, resources, and user-generated content.

### 3. Achievements System

To engage users actively in their pain management journey, we have implemented a game-mindset Achievements system. This feature is designed to draw attention to milestones and accomplishments, providing positive reinforcement and helping users reduce their reliance on substances.

## Future Enhancements

If we have more time to develop our platform, we have several exciting features planned for the future:

1. **Admin Actions:**
   - CRUD operations for users, categories, pain records, approaches, details, and achievements.

2. **Community Features:**
   - Expanded community features to enhance user interaction and support.
